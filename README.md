# React Effects and Refs Exercise

## Overview

A simple React application demonstrating the use of effects and refs by implementing a card drawing feature using the Deck of Cards API.

## Features

- Fetch and display a deck of cards.
- Auto-draw a card every second on button click until the deck is exhausted.
- Toggle between 'Start drawing' and 'Stop drawing' for card drawing control.
- Alert when no cards are left in the deck.

## Technologies

- React (Hooks: useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Deck of Cards API

## Setup

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/jencegram/deck_of_cards.git

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the application:
   npm start

## Learning Outcomes

This project was a practical exercise in understanding React's useEffect, useCallback, and useState hooks, and handling API data in a React application. The implementation of the auto-draw feature further demonstrated the use of intervals and state management.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the creators of the Deck of Cards API for enabling this functionality.
